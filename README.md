This mini project is built using:
- React (for UI development)
- TypeScript (for type safety and maintainability)
- Styled components (for component-level styling)

State Management:
- The cart state is managed using React Context API.
- Since this is a small-scale application, Context API is preferred over Redux, as it provides a simpler and more efficient way to handle state.

Start and build an app:
- npm start
- npm run build
